The Jenkins user's account is used to run jobs that ALM Octane runs.<br><br>
		<b>Notes:</b>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Make sure the user exists in Jenkins.
			</li>
			<li>
				We strongly recommend specifying a Jenkins user for ALM Octane. Set this user's permissions to the minimum required for this integration: <b>Job Build</b> permissions.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you do not specify a Jenkins user, ALM Octane uses the Anonymous user, and is limited to <b>Anonymous's</b> user permissions.
