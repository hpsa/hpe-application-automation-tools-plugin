    This build step is intended to support execution of automated tests from Micro Focus ALM Octane.</br>
    The builder searches for the "testsToRun" parameter which is sent from ALM Octane as part of the execution framework.</br>
    Once it is found, its value is converted to the format of the selected testing framework, and injected to the "testsToRunConverted" environment parameter.</br>
    Later, the new parameter can be used in the appropriate execution builder.
    <ul>
        <li> To use in other parameter <i>textboxes</i>, use the following syntax: <b>${testsToRunConverted}</b></li>
        <br/>
        <li> To use in the <i>scripts (shell, batch command)</i>, use the following syntax: (Windows) <b>%testsToRunConverted%</b>, and (Linux) <b>$testsToRunConverted</b>. For example
             <ul>
                 <li>(Surefire, Windows) <i>mvn clean -Dtest=%testsToRunConverted% test </i> </li>
                 <li>(Failsafe,   Linux) <i>mvn clean -Dit.test=$testsToRunConverted verify</i></li>
             </ul>
         </li>
        <br/>
        <li> To use in the <i>pipeline script (workflow job)</i>, use the following syntax : <b>${params.testsToRunConverted}</b>. For example: mvn clean -Dtest=${params.testsToRunConverted} test</li>
    </ul>
    </br>
    </br>
    * For <b>UFT</b>: In order to build a UFT MTBX file, this builder needs to know the test check-out directory. By default this is the job workspace directory.
    If tests are checked out in another directory, define in the job a String parameter "testsToRunCheckoutDirectory" with the correct directory.
    </br>
    ** For <b>JUnit/TestNG</b>: supported for JUnit 4.7+, Surefire Plugin 2.19+, Failsafe Plugin 2.12.1+
    </br>
