    When using this action, Jenkins understands and reads the Cucumber test report XML structure.
    After reading the structure, Jenkins can provide useful information about Cucumber tests results to ALM Octane.

    <p>
    To use the feature, ensure that you have added a Publish JUnit test results post-build action to your build.
    Then, specify the path to the Cucumber report XML files in the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">Ant glob syntax</a>.

    <br/>You can specify multiple patterns by separating them with commas.
    <br/>This path should only contain Cucumber report files. Note that no other test types will be reported from this job.
