    When using this action, Jenkins understands and reads the Cucumber test report XML structure.
    After reading the structure, Jenkins can provide useful information about Cucumber tests results to ALM Octane.

    <p>
    To use the feature, ensure that you have added a Publish JUnit test results post-build action to your build.
    Then, specify the path to the Cucumber report XML files in the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html">Ant glob syntax</a>.
    Be sure not to include any non-Cucumber-report files in this path. You can specify multiple patterns by separating them with commas.
