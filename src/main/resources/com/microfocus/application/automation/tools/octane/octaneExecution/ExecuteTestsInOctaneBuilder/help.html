    This build step is intended to support execution of automated tests from ALM Octane.</br>
    There are several modes of execution :

    <table border="1" width="100%" style="border-collapse: collapse;border: 1px solid black;">
        <thead style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold">
        <tr>
            <td width="30%">Mode</td>
            <td>Explanation</td>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Execute suite runs in ALM Octane</td>
            <td>Execute suites according to specified suite IDs. New suite runs will be created and executed in ALM Octane.
                Jenkins job is finished after triggering the suite runs. The job does not wait
                until the suite runs are finished. This method is useful if you want to schedule suite execution in ALM
                Octane. 
                <br>
                By default, newly created suite runs will have name of suite and will be assigned to default release.
                In order to override this default behaviour, add following parameters (one or more) to job with your desired values:
                <ul>
                    <li>octane_release_id</li>
                    <li>octane_new_suite_run_name</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Get tests from suites and trigger execution jobs</td>
            <td>Get tests from suites and trigger execution jobs</b> : Get tests from specified suite IDs. (This method
                assumes that tests are assigned to test runner jobs from the current Jenkins.) Tests are send to
                execution by their assigned test runner jobs. The main job is finished after the test runner jobs are
                finished.
                This method is useful if you intend to add your job to the ALM Octane Pipeline module.
