                <td>ALM Octane includes a built-in Jetty web server, but there is a possibility to add an external web server such as Apache HTTP server or similar.
                    This is usually done to add one more security layer. Some such servers might not allow receiving requests with encoded slashes (%2F).
                    As a job name might contain a slash, this parameter allows base64 encoding for job IDs during sending test results, build logs, coverage and vulnerabilities data to ALM OCtane.
                    <br/>
                    Default is false. Supported ALM Octane version 15.1.20 and above.</td>
