#### Current release branches
-	Each pull request merge that will pass module owner QA cycle will trigger a stable release to Jenkins experimental update center.
- Additional releases handled by the standard pull request process followed by a basic QA cycle of the related module.
-	Release to the Jenkins experimental update center (More information below).

- Each pull request will be tested, pass static code analysis and code review results.
- All efforts will be made to expedite this process.

#### Guidelines
- Document your code – it enables others to continue the great work you did on the code and update it.
- SonarLint your code – we use SonarQube with its basic built-in rule set. In the future, we will provide direct online access to test with a custom rule set.
