# ALM Integration

You can use this plugin to run ALM tests sets and use ALM Lab Management with the Jenkins continuous integration.

If you are working with Quality Center 10.00 or earlier, and QuickTest Professional 9.x or 10.x, use the [[Quality Center Plugin]](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Quality+Center+Plugin).

## Configure the connection to ALM

To configure the connection to your ALM Server.

1.  Go to the Jenkins Server home page.

2.  Click the **Manage Jenkins** link in the left pane. 

3.  In the Manage Jenkins Page click **Configure System**.

4.  In the Configuration tab, scroll down to the **Application Lifecycle
    Management** section.

5.  Click **Add ALM server**, if no server is currently configured.

6.  Specify a meaningful server name and URL. When specifying an ALM
    Server URL, use the full string: `http:/myserver.mydomain/qcbin`.

## Run Test Sets from ALM

####  **Set up a job**

1.  Go to the Jenkins Server home page.

2.  Click the **New Job** link or select an existing job.

3.  Enter a Job name (for a new job).

4.  Select **Build a free-style software project** and click **OK**.

5.  In the Project Configuration section scroll down to
    the **Build** section.

6.  Expand the **Add build** **step** drop-down and select **Execute
    functional tests from ALM**.

7.  Select one of the ALM servers that you configured in the previous
    step.

8.  Enter the server credentials, project and domain. For ALM 14, use the API Key client ID and secret as the username and password. **Note:** If you are using the ALM scheduler, it will run
    under the Jenkins agent user. For example, if Jenkins is running as a **System** user, the scheduler will run the tests as a **System** user. This will not affect test execution. 
    
9.  Add the test set folders or specific test sets that you want to include, using the ALM path. To add a specific test, add the test name after the test set path. To add multiple entries, click the down arrow on the right of the field and enter each item on a separate line. See the example below.
    
10. Optionally, indicate a timeout in seconds after which the job will fail.
    
11. Click **Advanced** to indicate a Run mode (local, remote, or planned host) If you specify a remote host mode, specify a host name. This must be a machine with a valid installation of the testing tool.
    
12. Click **Apply** to save your changes and continue with more build
    steps. Click **Save** when you are finished adding build steps.
